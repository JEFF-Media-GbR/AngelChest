Hey guys =),

as from another ticket I had with mfnalex (Comission ticket):

mfnalex [EN/DE] — heute um 01:57 Uhr
"pls add an option to have a separate angelchest-duration for pvp and no-pvp kills in angelchest"

We need that so if people get killed on pvp, the pvp killer can't steal their items after the chest despawns. So it would be gread to have either:

a second duration time for pvp kills which we can set on infinite
the possibility to teleport to a chest for free after a pvp kill
the possibility to teleport the chest to the owner for free after a pvp kill
