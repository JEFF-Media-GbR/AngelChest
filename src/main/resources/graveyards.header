##### PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChest Plus!

You can define certain graveyard areas here. If a player dies in a world where graveyards are enabled,
the AngelChest will not spawn at the player's death location, but somewhere inside the nearest graveyard.
Chunks containing graveyard's will never be unloaded.

Every graveyard must have specified AT LEAST the location (world, min.x, min.y, min.z, max.x, max.y, max.z)


Optional values:


  global: When set to true, players will be sent to this graveyard when there is no graveyard in the player's current world.
          You should only define one global graveyard.
          When not set, it defaults to false.

          Example:
            global: true


  only-spawn-on: When set, the graves will only spawn on top of the given blocks.
                 When not set, graves can spawn on top of any block.

                 Example:
                   only-spawn-on:
                   - ROOTED_DIRT
                   - GRAVEL


  material: When set, the AngelChests in this graveyard will use this material
            When not set, AngelChests will use the default material

            Example:
              material: CANDLE


  hologram-text: Set a custom hologram text that only applies to graves in this graveyard.

                 Example:
                   hologram-text: "&c&l[Rest in Peace]&r\n&7Here lies\nÂ§6{player}\nKilled by {deathcause}"


  spawn: You can define a location where players will be spawned after they were buried at this graveyard.
         When not set, AngelChest will not change the player's spawn location.
         You can also define another world. If world is not set, it uses the graveyard's world.
         Yaw is the "left/right" rotation of the player.
              0 = facing south
             90 = facing west
            180 = facing north
            270 = facing east
         Pitch is the "up/down" rotation of the player.
              0 = facing straightforward
            -90 = facing at the sky
             90 = facing at the ground.

          Example:
            spawn:
              x: 20.5
              y: 64
              z: 30
              yaw: 90             (optional)
              pitch: 0            (optional)
              world: otherworld   (optional)


  instant-respawn: When true, players will be instantly respawned after being buried in this graveyard.
                   You will probably only want to use this when you defined a spawn for this graveyard.
                   Defaults to false.

                   Example:
                     instant-respawn: true


  totem-animation: When true, players will be shown a totem of undying animation when they respawn inside
                   a graveyard. You will probably only want to use this when you defined a spawn for this
                   graveyard.
                   You can set this to true to play a regular totem animation, or use an integer if you
                   are using CustomModelData for your totems.
                   Defaults to false.

                   Example:
                     totem-animation: true
                   or:
                     totem-animation: 3
