##### PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChest Plus!

# You can define certain graveyard areas here. If a player dies in a world where graveyards are enabled,
# the AngelChest will not spawn at the player's death location, but somewhere inside the nearest graveyard.
# Chunks containing graveyard's will never be unloaded.

# Every graveyard must have specified AT LEAST the location (world, min.x, min.y, min.z, max.x, max.y, max.z)


# Optional values:


#  only-spawn-on: When set, the graves will only spawn on top of the given blocks.
#                 When not set, graves can spawn on top of any block.
#
#    Example:
#
#    only-spawn-on:
#      - DIRT
#      - GRAVEL


#  material: When set, the AngelChests in this graveyard will use this material
#            When not set, AngelChests will use the default material
#
#    Example:
#
#    material: CANDLE


#  hologram-text: Set a custom hologram text that only applies to graves in this graveyard.
#
#    Example:
#
#    hologram-text: "&a&l[AngelChest]&r\n&b{player}\n&7{items} items / {xp} XP\n&6{time}\n&cKilled by {deathcause}"
