##### PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChest Plus!

# You can define certain graveyard areas here. If a player dies in a world where graveyards are enabled,
# the AngelChest will not spawn at the player's death location, but somewhere inside the nearest graveyard.
# Chunks containing graveyard's will never be unloaded.

# Every graveyard must have specified AT LEAST the location (world, min.x, min.y, min.z, max.x, max.y, max.z)


# Optional values:


#  global: When set to true, players will be sent to this graveyard when there is no graveyard in the player's current world.
#          You should only define one global graveyard.
#          When not set, it defaults to false.
#
#    Example:
#
#    global: true


#  only-spawn-on: When set, the graves will only spawn on top of the given blocks.
#                 When not set, graves can spawn on top of any block.
#
#    Example:
#
#    only-spawn-on:
#      - DIRT
#      - GRAVEL


#  material: When set, the AngelChests in this graveyard will use this material
#            When not set, AngelChests will use the default material
#
#    Example:
#
#    material: CANDLE


#  hologram-text: Set a custom hologram text that only applies to graves in this graveyard.
#
#    Example:
#
#    hologram-text: "&a&l[AngelChest]&r\n&b{player}\n&7{items} items / {xp} XP\n&6{time}\n&cKilled by {deathcause}"


#  spawn: You can define a location where players will be spawned after they were buried at this graveyard.
#         When not set, AngelChest will not change the player's spawn location.
#         You can also define another world. If world is not set, it uses the graveyard's world.
#         Yaw is the "left/right" rotation of the player.
#               0 = facing south
#              90 = facing west
#             180 = facing north
#             270 = facing east
#         Pitch is the "up/down" rotation of the player.
#               0 = facing straightforward
#             -90 = facing at the sky
#              90 = facing at the ground.
#
#    Example:
#
#    spawn:
#      x: 20.5
#      y: 64
#      z: 30
#      yaw: 90             (optional)
#      pitch: 0            (optional)
#      world: otherworld   (optional)


#  instant-respawn: When true, players will be instantly respawned after being buried in this graveyard.
#                   You will probably only want to use this when you defined a spawn for this graveyard.
#                   Defaults to false.


#  totem-animation: When true, players will be shown a totem of undying animation when they respawn inside
#                   a graveyard. You will probably only want to use this when you defined a spawn for this
#                   graveyard.
#                   You can set this to true to play a regular totem animation, or use an integer if you
#                   are using CustomModelData for your totems.
#                   Defaults to false.
