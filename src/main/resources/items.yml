# PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChest Plus!
#

# You can use custom items instead of money for everything that allows you to set a price!
# You can assign different items to different actions. For example, you can require a certain
# item to open an AngelChest, and another item to teleport to it.

# IMPORTANT: Items are defined by their "ID". That means existing items will still work
# when you change item names, lore, etc. here, as long you as you do not change the ID.
# In the following example item, the ID is "teleport-token".

# To make players require such item instead of money, simply set the corresponding
# price setting (e.g. "price-teleport") in your config.yml to the item's ID
# (for example: "price-teleport: teleport-token").

# Please note that the groups.yml does NOT support defining items per group. That means:
# You can either use different amount of money per group, or one item that applies to all
# players.

# You can use hex colors and hex gradients in the display-name and lore.
# Hex Color:     <#ff0000>Red text
# Hex Gradients: <#ff0000>Red to green text<#/00ff00>
