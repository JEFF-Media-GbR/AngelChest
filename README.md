## How to compile

If you just need a working .jar file, buy AngelChest Plus on SpigotMC (link is above). If you have a legit reason to compile this yourself, join my Discord server and ask for help there (link is below).

TL;DR: You cannot simply run `mvn package` on this. And I won't help you how to do it. Buy the plugin on SpigotMC.
