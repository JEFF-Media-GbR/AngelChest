...and may the odds be ever in your favor! [B]Never lose your stuff to looting players again![/B] When you die, an [B][I]AngelChest [/I][/B]is created. The chest will be locked for a configurable amount of time, and then just drops its contents. You can also unlock your chest, for example if you died in company of a friend, or have it unlock automatically after a specified amount of time. The chest will hold your complete inventory including armor slots. Experience or experience levels can also be stored. You can also set the duration per player, just see the groups.example.yml file.

[/CENTER]
When you rightclick the [B][I]AngelChest[/I][/B], your inventory will be restored. If not all items can be stored (because you picked something up after respawning), the remaining items will be left in the chest and you can decide which items you want to take/leave behind. You can also directly open the chest via shift-rightclick if you wish to take only some items (see screenshots at the bottom of the description). Once the chest is emptied or the duration is reached, it will despawn and drop the remaining items.

Players can have more than one [B]AngelChest[/B]. They can teleport themself to their chests, or fetch the chests to oneself (see permissions below). You can also set a custom price for spawning, opening, teleporting to or fetching the chest to use with economy plugins (only if you have Vault installed).

It is also possible to limit the cases when a chest spawns, e.g. you can disable it for lava deaths or during PvP, or disallow it from being locked or collecting XP during PvP, in certain WorldGuard regions, etc.

All messages are 100 % customizable. Also the config file includes more than 130 options!

AngelChestPlus uses bStats to gather statistics. You can disable this by editing the plugins/bstats/config.yml file. View the statistics here: [URL]https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/AngelChest[/URL]

If your language is not yet supported, just change the messages in the config file yourself. I will be happy to include the language in the next update if you send me your translation.
